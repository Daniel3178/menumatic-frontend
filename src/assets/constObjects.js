      instructions:
        "Using a vegetable peeler, remove wide, long strips of potato peel and set aside. Finish peeling the potatoes. ( I had probably around a 1 1/2 c. peels.)\nHeat a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add chopped bacon and cook until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon to a paper towel-lined plate.\nTo the fat in the pan, add the potato skins and cook until crisp about 10 min. (You want to be sure they are crisp, or else they'll just be soggy and greasy, I took mine out at just the 10 minute mark and they weren't truly crisp, so I just spread them out on a cookie sheet and baked them in a 400 degree oven for around 5 minutes and they were very crisp after that.)\nRemove the crisped potato skins to the paper-lined plate with the bacon. Add the onion to the fat remaining in the pan, cook until tender and lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Add the thyme and flour, cook and stir for about a minute. Slowly whisk in the chicken broth and the half n half. Add the potatoes and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook until the potatoes are very tender, (you should be able to easly crush a piece of potato against the side of the pot with the back of a wooden spoon) about 10-15 minutes.\nUsing a blender, puree (in small batches) all but about 3 cups of the soup. Using a potato masher or your wooden spoon, lightly crush the potato chunks in the reserved potion of the soup. Add the pureed soup back to the pot and return to a low burner to keep the soup hot. Add in the 2 c. cheese, stir until melted, then add in the sour cream, stir well. Season to taste with salt & pepper. (Sometimes I like to add some of the crisped bacon into the soup mixture at this point, but that's optional.)\nTo serve, top bowls of soup with crisped bacon and potato skins, additional cheddar, sour cream and sliced scallion.",

      instructions:
        "Trim any large, thick pieces of fat from the brisket (dont remove all of the fat because it keeps the meat moist during cooking and adds flavor)\nSprinkle brisket with salt and pepper.\nMix the onion powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika, cumin, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl.\nDry rub both sides of the brisket with the seasoning mixture.\nHeat oil in a pan over medium-high heat and sear the meat on both sides.\nRemove from the heat and set aside.\nStir together the honey barbecue sauce and brown sugar.\nPour half of the sauce into the bottom of your slow cooker.\nPlace the brisket, fatty side up, into the slow cooker.\nCover the top o the brisket with the remaining sauce.\nCover the slow cooker and set heat to low for 9 hours, or until fork tender.\nWhen the brisket is cooked, remove it carefully from the slow cooker and place it on a cutting board.\nPour the sauce from the slow cooker into a saucepan and let it cool.\nSkim the fat that has risen to the top of the sauce in the large bowl.\nIt will appear lighter in color than the sauce, like droplets of oil on the surface. Skim as much fat as you can.\nIn a small bowl, stir together cornstarch and 1 tbs. of water till completely smooth.\nPour the cornstarch mixture into the bowl of sauce and stir to combine.\nReduce the sauce quickly in a saucepan on the stovetop by simmering it to 10 minutes.\nPour the sauce over the brisket and serve.\nThe leftovers make great BBQ sandwiches.\nIf you like crockpot food, be sure to check out some of my favorite recipes at www.mealdiva.com",

      instructions:
        "<ol><li>Season your thawed chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Add a little bit of olive oil to your frying pan, add chicken, and cook through. Remove chicken from pan, then add diced onions to the pan. Turn heat to medium and let onions saute through. (You may need to add a little bit more oil to the pan.)</li><li>Meanwhile, chop up your chicken (or shred) very finely. When the onions are soft and translucent, add chicken back to the pan. Season your onions and chicken with garlic, cumin, and chili powder. Finely chop up your jalapeno and add that and your green chilis to your chicken mixture. Stir in your cheese. Now you are ready to assemble.</li><li>Heat up your olive oil in a small frying pan. Add your corn tortilla for about 20 seconds, flipping if the oil doesn't reach the top side. Doing this softens your tortilla so it won't break as you roll it. Do this with all your tortillas and drain on paper towels.</li><li>Take 2 cookie sheets and spray with cooking spray. Lay out a tortilla and add about 2 TBSP of chicken mixture to the middle of your tortilla. Roll up. Fill the remaining tortillas in the same way and line them up next to each other on your cookie sheet, so they are very close to each other, but not touching. This should make two rows on each of your cookie sheets.</li><li>If two pans are too much for your family, then at this point, take one pan and put it in your freezer. Once the enchiladas are frozen, remove them from the pan and stack them in a double lined ziploc freezer bag. When you want to make them, simply line them up again on a greased cookie sheet, let thaw for about an hour on the counter, then bake as instructed.)</li><li>Now, bake your enchiladas in the oven, at 400 degrees, for about 20 minutes. They should be lightly browned. Remove them from the oven and spoon over about 2TBSP of your enchilada sauce over the top of each enchilada. Then sprinkle the tops with cheese. Put the enchiladas back in the oven for about 7 minutes. After that, it's time to eat!</li></ol>",

      instructions:
        "<ol><li>Peel the shallot and cut into quarters.  Make a small pouch out of aluminum foil (2 layers thick) and place inside the shallot and garlic.  Coat with olive oil and a generous pinch of salt.  Seal the pouch tightly and place in the oven (I recommend the toaster oven) at 400F for 30 minutes.</li><li>Rinse and pick clean the Brussels sprouts.  Cut each sprout in half, discarding any wilted outer leaves.  Steam the Brussels sprouts until tender when pierced with a fork.  Set aside.</li><li>Rinse and drain the beans.  Since, 1 can is a little too bean-heavy, save about 1/3 of the beans for something else.</li><li>Slice the kielbasa on a steep bias into 1/4 slices.  Heat 1 tsp. of olive oil in a large, heavy bottomed non-nonstick skillet over medium high heat.  Arrange the kielbasa slices and fry until crispy on each side, about 3 minutes per side. Set aside on paper towels to drain.</li><li>Add a generous tablespoon of good olive oil and keep the heat at medium high.  Unwrap the garlic and shallot and smash them using the flat side of your knife.  They should be very soft.  Add them to the skillet and cook for about 1 minute.</li><li>Add the mustard and cream to the skillet and stir to combine.  Reduce the heat to medium low and add the brussels sprouts and beans (as many as you want to use).  Toss everything together to coat, then season to taste with a generous amount of salt and black pepper.</li><li>Plate the kielbasa on top of your brussels sprouts and beans in a large bowl to serve.</li></ol>",

      instructions:
        "Trim any large, thick pieces of fat from the brisket (dont remove all of the fat because it keeps the meat moist during cooking and adds flavor)\nSprinkle brisket with salt and pepper.\nMix the onion powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika, cumin, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl.\nDry rub both sides of the brisket with the seasoning mixture.\nHeat oil in a pan over medium-high heat and sear the meat on both sides.\nRemove from the heat and set aside.\nStir together the honey barbecue sauce and brown sugar.\nPour half of the sauce into the bottom of your slow cooker.\nPlace the brisket, fatty side up, into the slow cooker.\nCover the top o the brisket with the remaining sauce.\nCover the slow cooker and set heat to low for 9 hours, or until fork tender.\nWhen the brisket is cooked, remove it carefully from the slow cooker and place it on a cutting board.\nPour the sauce from the slow cooker into a saucepan and let it cool.\nSkim the fat that has risen to the top of the sauce in the large bowl.\nIt will appear lighter in color than the sauce, like droplets of oil on the surface. Skim as much fat as you can.\nIn a small bowl, stir together cornstarch and 1 tbs. of water till completely smooth.\nPour the cornstarch mixture into the bowl of sauce and stir to combine.\nReduce the sauce quickly in a saucepan on the stovetop by simmering it to 10 minutes.\nPour the sauce over the brisket and serve.\nThe leftovers make great BBQ sandwiches.\nIf you like crockpot food, be sure to check out some of my favorite recipes at www.mealdiva.com",
